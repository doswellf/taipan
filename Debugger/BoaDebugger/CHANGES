Alan Milligan (alan.milligan@last-bastion.net) did the following:

* completely removed the BoaDebugger and BoaBreakpoint products as these were
  actually not products ...

* Made BoaDebugger a singleton Product in the root folder - this happens automatically
  upon product installation - look for the blue python icon ;)

* the BoaDebugger has tabs to start, and stop the debugging listener, and another
  tab to go into debug mode.  Apart from the obvious functionality, I found it very
  confusing that my browser just 'spun' when hitting the old 'start' button.  
  Explicitly separating these functions makes the process less surprising for me at 
  least ...

* the BoaDebugger has a volatile state variable determining it's active status to
  internally sync it's various states

* there's a help page explaining how it all works

* All BoaDebugger functions are controlled by the Zope security machinery under the
  'View Management Screens' permission

Hope this helps ...
