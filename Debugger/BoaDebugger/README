BoaDebugger
===========

ABOUT
BoaDebugger is a Zope product that enables debugging
of Zope applications with the Boa-Constructor 
developing environment. It was put together by 
phil@bluedynamics.com and robert@bluedynamics.com
during a train travel to a plone-sprint in Bern, 
Switzerland and tidied up by gogo@bluedynamics.com.

INSTALLATION
BoaDebugger is a zope Product. 
Build a zip file (BoaDebugger.zip) containing the 
product installation by running the BuildProduct.py 
script inside the BoaDebugger directory.
Unzip it in your Zopes Product Folder like a normal 
product and it should be ready to use.

USAGE
1.) In the ZMI (Zope Management Interface) select 
"BoaDebugger" and click "Add". You can provide a 
username, password, ip-adress and port for the 
debugger process.
2.) In your Boa select "Attach to Debugger" from the 
"File" Menu in the Editor. This Menu entry will only
show up if you have some Python file open in the
editor (.py). It is not there for Text files, for example.
You have to use the same username, password, 
ip-adress and port you were using before. It is okay to
leave username and password blank if you don't want
to restrict debugging to authenticated users only (for 
example in a developement LAN).
3.) If you want to test the BoaDebugger you can add a
"BoaBreakpoint" in the ZMI. This should kick your Boa
to a hardcoded sys.breakpoint(). Once the first 
hardcoded breakpoint is reached you can use 
soft-breakpoints without any restriction. Some users 
experienced some trouble when they were using 
soft-breakpoints; It just didn't work until any hardcoded 
breakpoint was reached. Others had no problem with 
that.

AT THE MOMENT IT DOES NOT WORK WITH BOA >2.3.8 AND i
ZOPE 2.7 :(
