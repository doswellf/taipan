<p>
Boa IDE can be extended by registering new Components, Controllers or Explorers.

<p>
Here is a backaground to the classes involved.

<h3>Companions</h3>
For every control/object that can participate in the Designer, there has to be
a Companion class. Companions implement the interfaces needed to interact with
the Inspector and the Designer, basically the design-time behaviour. 
Companions can also define/override new properties for an object not picked up 
through reflection.

<h3>Properties</h3>
Properties are defined by introspection and Companion classes.
<p>
e.g. When a wxTextCtrl is inspected in the Designer, the following is found by 
introspection:
<font color="#101090"><pre>
wxTextCtrl.GetValue()
wxTextCtrl.SetValue(value)
</pre></font>

So a Property named <b>Value</b> will be picked up automatically.
<p>
During introspection it's getter is called and the type is inspected. 
Simple types like ints, string, etc are handled automatically.
<p>
When a property is a reference to an object (for which the getter
could possibly return None) or some other type which cannot be
determined by introspection alone, a property definition must be added
the associated companion class. Update the <b>editors</b> attribute.
It's a dictionary of this format:
<font color="#101090"><pre>
PropertyName: PropertyEditorClass
</pre></font>

Property values can be 'routed' in many ways. 
<table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#000000"><tr><td>
<table CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=4>
<tr>
<td WIDTH="25%" VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR="#ddeeff" >

<b>CtrlRoute</b></td>
<td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR="#ddeeff" >


Get and Set maps directly to component Get and Set.<br>
This type is automatically picked up by inspection.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td WIDTH="25%" VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR="#ddeeff" >

<b>CompnRoute</b></td>
<td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR="#ddeeff" >


Get and Set maps to Companion Get and Set.<br>
Used when you need to fully customise a property.<br>
Used when the Get and Set methods of the control do not map to Get*, Set*, 
e.g. Show() and IsShown().<br>
Used when new (possibly computed) properties are needed for which there are 
no methods on the component.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td WIDTH="25%" VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR="#ddeeff" >

<b>EventRoute</b></td>
<td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR="#ddeeff" >


Used by Event definitions.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td WIDTH="25%" VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR="#ddeeff" >

<b>IndexRoute</b></td>
<td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR="#ddeeff" >


Used by collection editor properties.<br>
Get and Set maps to Companion Get and Set with index.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td WIDTH="25%" VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR="#ddeeff" >

<b>NameRoute</b></td>
<td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR="#ddeeff" >


Used when a property is split up into a set of flags.
Get and Set maps to Companion Get and Set with name.
</td></tr>

</table>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
For property names which are not picked up by inspection the
<b>properties</b> method can be overridden. Here you extend the inherited 
property dictionary.<br>
Format: 
<font color="#101090"><pre>
ProperyName: (RouteType, Getter, Setter)
</pre></font>

There is also support for enumerated types, dependant properties, 
linked properties, non persisting, multi parameter and completely 
custom properties which overrides everything down to code generation 
(e.g. Anchors/Constraints).

<h3>Property Editors</h3>
PropertyEditor classes are associated with types or property names.<br>
<p>
They only focus on editing values and don't interface with the object whose 
properties they edit.
<p>
In the <b>edit</b> method a PropertyEditor should create an 
<b>InspectorEditorControl</b> derived class that will be used by the Inspector.

<h3>Explorer Nodes</h3>
Explorer nodes plug into Models to provide their transport (storage). Various transports
are defined by default, filesystem, FTP, etc.<br>
<p>

<h3>MVC Pattern</h3>
The Boa IDE is built on the Model-View-Controller pattern.
<p>
Here is a quick rundown of the roles:

<h3>Models</h3>
Models usually represent the different types of source files. In the Editor the Model 
is the object in the top level notebook. Users do not perform actions on the Model 
directly but works through Views or Controllers.
<p>
To add a new model you need to do the following:
<ul>
<li>Derive a new model class from <b>EditorModels.EditorModel</b> or a descendant.</li>
<li>Add a 24x24 png image to <b>Images/Palette</b>. This will be used on the New palette page.<br>
It must have the same name as the <b>modelIdentifier</b> class attribute.</li>
<li>Add a 16x16 png image to <b>Images/Modules</b>. This will be used as the IDE 
notebook and Explorer images.<br>
It must have the same name as the <b>bitmap</b> class attribute.
Also, an image index must be allocated with <b>Models.EditorUtils.imgIdxRange</b> 
and set to the <b>idx</b> class attribute.</li>
<li>Derive an new Controller from Controller.BaseEditorController or a descendant.<br>
Set the Controller's <b>Model</b> class attribute to reference your Model class.</li>
<li>If additional views are needed, derive from an existing View and associate it 
with the Controller via the Controller's <b>DefaultViews</b> and 
<b>AdditionalViews</b> class attributes.</li>
</ul>
There are many examples of how to do this, e.g. see <i>Plug-ins/PascalSupport.plug-in.py</i>
for a self contained example.

<h3>Views</h3>
Views are visual classes that display or edit Models. In the Editor, Views plug into 
the Model in a second level notebook. Actions on the View are published to the Editor
under the 'Edit' menu.
<p>
To add a new view to a model you need to do the following:
<ul>
<li>Derive a new view class from <b>Views.EditorViews.EditorView</b> or a descendant.</li>
<li>Add the view to the Controller class associated with the model.<br>
There are two tuples defining the views of the model, <b>Controller.DefaultViews</b> and 
<b>Controller.AdditionalViews</b>. Add your new view to one of them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Controllers</h3>
Controllers are a gateway between the user and the Model. Controllers are also 
factories for Models and manage the creation from the Palette and recreation from file.
Controllers also publish the available Model actions to the Editor as Toolbar buttons
or Menu items under the 'File' menu.
<p>
The Controller classes should also handle GUI code and interactions with the IDE
like refreshing, dialog boxes and status indications.

<h3>Plug-ins</h3>
New non-core Boa extensions should be added as plug-ins.<br>
All modules in the <b>Plug-ins</b> directory of the form <b>*.plug-in.py</b>
will be executed at startup.<br>
If there is a Plug-ins directory defined in your
<a href="Preferences.html#ResourceConfig">resource config</a> 
directory, it's modules will also be executed.
You may also spesify another additional plug-in directory by setting 
Preferences->Plug-ins->Core support->extraPluginPath.
