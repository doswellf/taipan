<img SRC="Boa.jpg" height=32 width=32>&nbsp; Philosophy</h2>




Boa is supposed to be a simple Delphi for wxPython. <br>
It is an IDE for Python development including visual wxPython frame
design, object browsers, documentation genaration, debugging,
source control (CVS) and more.
The Boa IDE also integrates with other Python technologies like Zope, PyChecker, 
Py2Exe, Distutils and Cyclops.
Eventually I would also like to aid Extension development through much deeper
distutils support.
<p>
One of the philosophies I try to keep with is to purely be a time/effort saving
code generator/manager, not a library/framework. There are no Boa files that must
be distributed with your app, just the generated source. 
This is the principle behind storing object data as source code code 
as opposed to XML, some pickled datastructure or
fileformat. I intend to support export to XML at a later stage, but the core
will stay code generation.<br>
For a new wxPython user code generation has immediate educational value.
Generated code can also be manually tweaked, copied to the clipboard from
the designer and pasted into your source.<br>
Yet another thing which code (as opposed to resources or xml) allow is
<i>design-once</i> style where you define the overall structure
of a frame with the designers, remove the Boa identifiers (e.g. #Boa:Frame:wxFrame1)
and completely customise the frame object. For frames with a very dynamic runtime 
nature, this is sometimes required.<br>
I also want the generated code to be able to interact as much as possible with 
your own code.<br>
