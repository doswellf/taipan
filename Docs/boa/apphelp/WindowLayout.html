wxPython offers various flavours of window layout. The two main systems are 
<b>Constraints</b> and <b>Sizers</b>.
<p>
<b>Constraints</b> allow layout relationships to be setup between controls and edges.<br>
A constraint must define 4 valid individual layout constraints or chaos will ensue.<br>
Boa offers support but not complete integration of constraints currently. They can be 
set up in the Collection Editor accessible from the <i>Constraints</i> property of controls.<br>
One problem is currently is that the relative offsets (margin and value) are not kept
in sync when controls are moved and sized.
<p>
There are two more modules to help with this somewhat tedious 
to setup, but powerful layout mechanism.<br>
They can be found in <b>wxPython.lib</b> as <b>layoutf</b> and <b>anchors</b>.<br>
With <b>layoutf</b> constraints can be specified in concise printf like format.
There is no built-in support for <b>layoutf</b> in Boa but they can be added by hand. 
See the layoutf's source for documentation<br>
The <b>LayoutAnchors</b> class in <b>anchors</b> derives from <b>wxLayoutConstraint</b>
and can be used in it's place. They offer a simple subset of normal constraints where
the sides of a control may be 'anchored' on it's parent. Anchors are completely
integrated into the Designer and available by right clicking on a selection tag in the 
Designer or from the <i>Anchors</i> property of controls.<br>
See <a href="LayoutAnchors.html">LayoutAnchors</a> for detailed info.
<p>
<b>Sizers</b> allow controls and other sizers to be packed horizontally and vertically
in window. They can grow, align to sides, proportionally resize or be centered.<br>
Boa has no built-in support for sizers currently. I have trouble integrating them into 
Boa's current design time framework. They also need special visual support in the Designer 
, and the 'packing' of controls goes against the current placing and sizing methodology.
Support is planned at a later stage.<br>
Remember that you can always add Sizers by hand (to __init__) if you really need them. 
<p>
Please note that a window's <i>AutoLayout</i> property should be set to true for
the window to automatically apply layout for sizers and constraints.
If this is not set you'll have to call Layout() yourself in the OnSize event of the 
window, but constraints will not be applied for that window at design-time.<br>
